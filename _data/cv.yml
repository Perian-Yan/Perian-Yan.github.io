      institution: Automatic Control Lab (IfA) ETH Z端rich
      year: Jul 2022 - Oct 2022
      description:
        - Transversal Hyperplane Selection in Identification of Local Limit Cycle Dynamics, under the supervision of Mingzhou Yin and Prof. Roy Smith.
        - Developed a non-convex optimization algorithm to select hyperplanes for identification.
        - Implemented the proposed algorithm and kernel-based identification on numerical examples including the Van der Pol oscillator and a periodic trajectory generated from closed-loop control.
        - Used Matlab optimization tools such as fmincon and particleswarm.
